There are many questions that we came across in our first reading of the short story.Pick some of these questions and try to answer them. Discuss and use ideas/hints from the text.Here are the questions:Who is the fanatic? father/son?What reasons do we have to believe that the father is the fanatic?Why is the son the fanatic?Is Ali's behaviour ok?Are both fanatics?Why did Bettina react like she did?Why did Ali not protect himself?Why did Ali devolope such a sharp tongue?Why is Parvez judging his son in this bad way?Why does Parvez not talk to his son? But doing "secret investigations" instead?Did Parvez have sexual intercourse with Bettina?What is going to happen next?
